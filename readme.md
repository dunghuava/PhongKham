## Using vue-i18n

Next, you need to install one out of two supported VueJs i18n libraries. We support [vue-i18n](https://github.com/kazupon/vue-i18n) as default library. Beside that we also support [vuex-i18n](https://github.com/dkfbasel/vuex-i18n).

When you go with the default option, you only need to install the library through your favorite package manager.
### vue-i18n
```
npm i --save vue-i18n
```

```
yarn add vue-i18n
```

Then generate the include file with
```
php artisan vue-i18n:generate
```
